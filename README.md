# Gig Grid - Musician Platform

A comprehensive platform connecting musicians with fans, venues, and booking opportunities.

## BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Approach

This project follows a BDD methodology where features are defined in plain English using Gherkin syntax before implementation. This ensures that all stakeholders understand the requirements and expected behavior.

## BDD Tags for Organization

### User Type Tags
- `@fan-registration` - Fan-specific scenarios
- `@artist-registration` - Artist registration flows
- `@band` - Band-specific functionality
- `@solo-artist` - Solo artist features

### Feature Tags

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Planning**
   - Choose technology stack (React Native, Flutter, Next.js, etc.)
   - Set up development environment with Amazon SES
   - Create project architecture supporting user type differentiation

2. **Step Definitions**
   - Implement Cucumber/Behave step definitions
   - Create test automation framework with CSV data integration
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with test data management

3. **Backend Development**
   - Design database schema for fans, bands, and solo artists
   - Implement API endpoints with user type-specific logic
   - Set up authentication system with Amazon SES integration

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Create responsive UI components with conditional rendering
   - Implement dynamic forms based on user type selection
   - Add real-time features and validation

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with comprehensive data coverage
   - Integration tests using CSV test data
   - End-to-end tests across all user types
   - Performance testing with multiple user scenarios

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Clear Requirements**: Features written in business language
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All user types and scenarios included
