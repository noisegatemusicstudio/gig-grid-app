# GigGrid Mobile App

A React Native mobile application built with Expo for connecting freelancers with gig opportunities.

## Features

- **Welcome Page**: Beautiful onboarding experience with app overview
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and modern design
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and Web
- **Expo Development**: Fast development with Expo Go and web preview

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Expo CLI (installed automatically with npx)
- For mobile testing: Expo Go app on your phone

### Installation & Running

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm run install-deps
```

2. Start the Expo development server (auto-handles port conflicts):
```bash
npm start
```

3. Run on different platforms:
```bash
npm run web     # Open in web browser
npm run ios     # Open iOS simulator
npm run android # Open Android emulator
```

### ðŸš€ Auto Port Management

Our setup automatically handles port conflicts! The start script will:
- âœ… Kill any existing Expo/Metro processes
- âœ… Free up common Expo ports (8081-8085, 19000-19002)
- âœ… Start fresh with cleared cache
- âœ… No more manual port selection prompts!

Additional commands:
```bash
npm run clean      # Clean cache and kill processes
npm run start:fresh # Force fresh start (same as npm start)
```

### Testing on Device

1. Install Expo Go app from App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android)
2. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal
3. The app will load on your device instantly!
